# Running this app

### `npm start` to test locally

### `npm run build` to build the app

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## The app should be ready by now, if not, fix any missing/corrupt/obsolete/deprecated dependencies as npm is garbage and I can't do that for you

### `npm run eject` to delete the latest build, in case you want to re-build usinga different framework

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
